# Boolean Satisfiability
The Boolean Satisfiability Solver project involves the implementation of a program in OCaml to solve Boolean satisfiability problems. The goal is to determine if a given Boolean formula, expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), can be satisfied by assigning truth values to its variables.

The program takes a string representing a CNF formula as input and returns a list of variable assignments that satisfy the formula. If no solution exists, it returns an error message. The project required the implementation of several functions to parse and evaluate the CNF formula, generate possible variable assignments, and check if a specific assignment satisfies the formula.

This project helped to explore concepts in Boolean logic, OCaml programming, and algorithm design.
